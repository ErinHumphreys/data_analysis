##Import Covid tweets
```{r}
tweets_covid <- read.csv("data_raw/covid_tweets.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
tweets_covid
```


##Tokenising tweets_covid
```{r}
tidy_covid<- tweets_covid %>%
  select(created_at, screen_name,text,favorite_count,retweet_count) %>%
  unnest_tokens("word", text)
tidy_covid
```
```{r}
#### Separate date and time
tidy_covid <- tidy_covid %>% 
  separate(created_at, into = c("date", "time"), sep = "\\s", extra = "merge") %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date,"%Y-%m-%d"))
tidy_covid
```


##Removing stop words and more meaningless words
```{r}
data("stop_words")
tidy_covid<-tidy_covid %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
  filter(!(word == "https"|
           word == "rt" |
           word == "t.co" |
           word == "amp" |
           word == " ' " ))
tidy_covid
```
### Frequency of Positive vs. Negative words in Tweets related to Covid-19
<!-- negative and positive on one plot -->
```{r}
overall_covid <-
  tidy_covid %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>% 
  count(date, sentiment) %>% 
  spread(sentiment,n, fill = 0) 
overall_covid
```
<!-- positive and negative on one plot -->
```{r}
overall_covid_plot <- 
  ggplot(overall_covid, aes(x = date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y= negative),color="blue") +
  geom_line(aes(y = positive), color = "red") +
  theme_minimal()+
  ylab("Frequency of Positve vs. Negative Words in Tweets related to Covid-19")+
  xlab("Date")
overall_covid_plot
```

#### An upward tread exists in both positive (red) and negative (blue) tweeted regarding Covid-19 per day.For the majority of the graph, the negative words remain above the amount of positive words posted per day.A spike of negative words was recorded after the month of June. Recording 3 spikes in the number of negative tweets, followed by a fall in the the number of negative words in tweets. Although a fall in negative words was recorded a quarter way through the month of June, a gradual upward trend remained. The number of positive words that exist in tweets per day remained for the majorty of the time period below the negative words. This suggests that during and lockdown period, the media agencies had mostly posted tweets that contained negative sentiments rearding the Covid-19. As the number of negative words tweeted per day is substantially  higher than that of positive words tweeted per day.

### Visualise emotions of the covid tweets
```{r}
covid_nrc <-
  tidy_covid %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc")) %>% 
  count(sentiment) %>%
  group_by(sentiment)
  #spread(sentiment,n, fill = 0) 
covid_nrc
```

```{r}
ggplot(covid_nrc, aes(x=reorder(sentiment, -n), y=n, fill=sentiment))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+
  ylab("Number of Times sentiment appears in Covid-19 related tweets")+
  xlab("")+
  guides(fill=FALSE)
```
### With the use of the NRC lexicon, the resulting sentiments are different form using the BING lexicon. In this case positive words posted by media agencies have appeared the most.This can be deduced from the fact that teh NRC lexicon has more positive word associations than in the BING lexicon, but the BING lexicon has more negative word associations than the NRC lexicon.



### Sentiment over time per agency
```{r}
covid_nrc_day <-
  tidy_covid %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc")) %>% 
  count(date,sentiment) #%>%
  #group_by(sentiment)
  #spread(sentiment,n, fill = 0) 
covid_nrc_day
```

```{r}
ggplot(covid_nrc_day, aes(x=date,y = n))+
  geom_line(aes(fill = sentiment))+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+
  ylab("Number of Times sentiment appears in Covid-19 related tweets")+
  xlab("")+
  guides(fill=FALSE)+
  facet_wrap(~sentiment)
```
### Using the NRC lexicon, the categories have been faceted into their own plots. Clearly illustrating the number of times the sentiment appears in a tweet. The fear, negative, positive and trust sentiments show strong upward trends, which also display the highest recording of appearances.All in all the plots show a well distributed sentiment.

## Top 20 most frequently posted words
```{r}
covid_desc <- tidy_covid %>%
        count(word) %>%
        arrange(desc(n)) 
covid_desc
```


```{r, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
#select only top words
covid_20<-covid_desc[1:20,]
covid_20
```

<!-- ENDS HERE -->

#### Top 20 words plot
```{r}
#create factor variable to sort by frequency
covid_desc$word <- factor(covid_desc$word, levels = covid_desc$word[order(covid_desc$n,decreasing=TRUE)])


ggplot(covid_20, aes(x=reorder(word, -n), y=n, fill=word))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+
  ylab("Number of Times Word Appears in Covid-19 related tweets")+
  xlab("")+
  guides(fill=FALSE)
```
#### The most frequently tweeted word regarding Covid-19 is "covid" and "19". One can asssume that the most tweeted word by the media agencies would be "covid-19".

### Most common Positive and Negative words (Limited to 20)
```{r}
covid_contribution <-  tidy_covid %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>% 
  count(word,sentiment)
covid_contribution
  
```
```{r}
covid_contribution %>%
  group_by(sentiment) %>%
  top_n(20) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~sentiment, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(y = "Contribution to sentiment",
       x = NULL) +
  coord_flip()
```

### The above illustrates the top 20 positive and negative words that contributed to the sentiment of the Covid-19 tweets tweeted by the media agencies.

#### Frequency positive vs negative words per media acency regarding Covid-19
```{r}
overall_covid_agency <-
  tidy_covid %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>% 
  count(screen_name,date, sentiment) %>% # Count screen names assigns the number of positive and negative words per day by agency
  spread(sentiment,n, fill = 0) 
overall_covid_agency
```

```{r}
overall_covid_plot <- 
  ggplot(overall_covid_agency, aes(x = date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y= negative),color="blue") +
  geom_line(aes(y = positive), color = "red") +
  theme_minimal()+
  ylab("Frequency of Positve vs. Negative Words related to Covid-19 per Agency")+
  xlab("Date") +
  facet_wrap(~screen_name, ncol = 2)
overall_covid_plot
```

### The illustration above illustrates the number of positve(red) vs negative(blue) words present in the tweets of the 6 media agencies per day.ENCA, EWNupdates, IOL, SABCNews and TimesLIVE have all started posting tweets in the month of May. Whereas New24 only started posting in the Month of June reagrding Covid-19.
### ENCA,IOL, News24 and SABCNews has recorded the highest number of negative words since the start of June.
